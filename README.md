# Detecting Phishing Websites with Ensemble ML Models 🌐

Welcome to the "Detecting Phishing Websites with Ensemble ML Models" project! This project aims to identify phishing websites by analyzing website content and URL components using ensemble machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview 📋

- Created an ensemble machine learning model for phishing detection.
- Formulated the model using Python and various machine learning techniques.
- Incorporated five algorithms into the ensemble:
  - Decision Tree
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - XGBoost
  - Bagging Tree
  - Grid Search
- Developed and implemented the project using Google Colab.

## Key Features 🚀

- 🌐 Phishing Detection: The model analyzes website content and URL components to determine if a website is potentially phishing.
- 🧠 Ensemble ML: Utilizes the strength of multiple machine learning algorithms for robust detection.
- 📊 Performance Metrics: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishing-detection.git`
2. Set up your Python environment and install the required dependencies.
3. Open the project in Google Colab or your preferred development environment.
4. Run the provided Jupyter notebooks to experiment with the ensemble model.

## Usage 💡

- Use this project to explore and experiment with phishing website detection techniques.
